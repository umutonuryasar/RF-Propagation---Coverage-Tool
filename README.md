# RF-Propagation---Coverage-Tool

This project is designed to model and analyze radio frequency (RF) propagation and coverage. The tool provides simulations and visualizations for understanding how RF signals behave in various environments. It can be used for network planning, optimization, and other applications related to wireless communication systems.

## Features

- **RF Propagation Modeling**: Simulate RF signal propagation in different environments.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Visualize coverage maps and determine signal strength in specific areas.

## Installation
